I'm a software engineer at Microsoft. Formerly, I was a student research intern at Professor George D. Monta\~nez's AMISTAD Lab at Harvey Mudd College, where I received the [2024 Barry Goldwater scholarship](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/) and the [2025 Computing Research Association's Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award](https://cra.org/about/awards/outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-award/).
